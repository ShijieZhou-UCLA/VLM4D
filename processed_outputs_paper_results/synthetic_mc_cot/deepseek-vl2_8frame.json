By examining its orientation under the direction of the large sun in the sky, we can determine the direction it appears to be facing.\n\n1. Based on the bright sun visible in the top center of all the images, one can infer that the rover (olairena) is facing towards or away from the light source based on the shadows and highlights. The opposite will be true if not facing the sunlight, as it creates strong shadows.\n2. In all frames, the bright sun remains constant in position. The rover’s front section is always facing towards the unBLURRED sides of the image, extended towards the horizon and rocky structures, suggesting forward motion.\n3. Observing the alignment of the rover with the sun's setting or rising position relative to the horizon, we can see that it moves backward in rising-up motion (`Answer D`).",
