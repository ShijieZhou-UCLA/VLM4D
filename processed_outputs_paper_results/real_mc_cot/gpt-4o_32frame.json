During a drift, the car's rear end is often sliding out, opposite to the direction the car is moving. \n   \n2. **Direction of the Car's Nose:**\n   - Look at the front of the car. It continues to point to the left of the image across the sequence. This suggests a predominant motion to the left relative to the camera’s viewpoint.\n   \n3. **Track Layout and Car’s Path:**\n   - The track curves primarily to the left from the camera angle, matching the drift trajectory which supports the visual cue that the car is moving left.\n\n4. **Eliminating Other Directions:**\n   - **Backwards (A):** Unlikely, as the direction of movement and the drift do not appear to support a retreat.\n   - **Forwards (C):** Car is not oriented nose-first in a direct line that aligns with camera forward direction.\n   - **Right (D):** Opposite to the motion of the drift, unlikely given the continuous leftward path.\n\nTherefore, considering the above observations and the typical motion of a car in a drift relative to the view from the camera, the car is moving in the left direction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B",

One is a blue engine, another is a red car, and the third is a grey car between them. We need to figure out the direction of movement.\n\n2. **Direction of Movement**: The series of images shows the train moving forward in a clockwise direction. Based on this layout, it looks like the blue engine is at the front, followed by the grey car, and the red car is at the back. The engine and cars are moving from right to left around the track.\n\n3. **Counting Cars Moving to the Left**: All visible train sections—the blue engine, the grey car, and the red car—are moving to the left around the curve of the track.\n\nSince there are three components visible that are moving together, we can conclude that the number of train cars moving to the left, in addition to the visible locomotive, are two (the grey and red cars).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C",
