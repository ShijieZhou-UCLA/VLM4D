Since in the image we see the basketball higher up, it is in the process of descending to its current position.\n\nNow, let’s examine the positions of the basketball in terms of their relative positions. In the first image, the basketball is closer to the camera. Since a basketball thrown upwards will ultimately come right back down, the final image represents this point - the ball is moving downward towards a low position which is in front of the camera.\n\nSo, in the frame provided, the basketball is descending from a higher position towards a lower position - towards the camera.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C",
