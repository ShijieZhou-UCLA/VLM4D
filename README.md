## TODO
- [x] Release dataset
- [x] Release evaluation code  
<!-- - [ ] EvalAI server setup -->

<!-- ## :fire: News -->
<!-- * **[2025.07.14]** We integrate the benchmark into [AGI-Eval](https://agi-eval.cn/evaluation/detail?id=66) platform. More models and results will be updated there. -->



## Dataset Structure
The dataset can be downloaded from Hugging Face.
Each entry in the dataset contains the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each evaluation question
- `video`: Hugging Face URL of the video
- `question_type`: We use the objective question type "multiple-choice" 
- `question`: The question
- `choices`: 4 choices for the multiple-choice question
- `answer`: Ground-truth answer to the question


## Example Entry

```json
[
    {
        "id": "validation_160",
        "video": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/shijiezhou/VLM4D/resolve/main/videos_real/davis/city-ride.mp4",
        "question_type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "From the camera perspective, which direction are the cyclists moving toward?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "not moving",
            "B": "left",
            "C": "right",
            "D": "backwards"
        },
        "answer": "left"
    }
]
```


## Evaluation

### 1. Setup
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Response Generation
Run the scripts under `model_inference_scripts`, for example:
```bash
bash model_inference_scripts/run_vllm_video_models.sh 
```

The model outputs are saved in the `outputs/{data_type}_{prompt}` directory, where:

- `{data_type}`  
  - `real_mc`: multiple-choice answers on real video data  
  - `synthetic_mc`: multiple-choice answers on synthetic video data  

- `{prompt}`  
  - `cot`: chain-of-thought reasoning  
  - `direct-output`: direct answers without intermediate reasoning steps  


### 3. Evaluation
To evaluate the generated responses, run the following command:
```bash
python acc_evaluation.py --output_dir outputs/real_mc_cot
```

The evaluation results are saved in the `outputs/processed_outputs/` directory. 

As illustrated in our paper, the LLM-as-judge may occasionally make mistakes. To address this, we also provide manually verified evaluation results, obtained by cross-checking the outputs of two LLM judges (OpenAI o3 and o4-mini), which can be found in `processed_outputs/o4mini_verified/`.


Finally, run the following command to generate the statistics of the evaluation results:
```bash
python acc_final_statistics.py
```
Where you are free to set the output folders inside.
